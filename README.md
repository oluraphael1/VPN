In a typical site-to-site VPN setup, a company might have its main office in New York and a branch office in San Francisco. Both locations have their own local networks and a VPN gateway. The VPN gateways at each site create an encrypted tunnel over the internet, securely connecting the two networks.
In summary, a site-to-site VPN is an essential tool for businesses needing to securely connect multiple geographically dispersed networks, ensuring secure, cost-effective, and efficient communication and resource sharing.
